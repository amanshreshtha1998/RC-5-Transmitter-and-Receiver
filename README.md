# RC-5-Transmitter-and-Receiver

Advisor: Dr. Kishore Sarwadekar, IIT(BHU), Varanasi

Designed an IR Transmitter Module based on RC-5 protocol and implemented it on Nexys4 Artix-7 FPGA
board. The circuit was designed and tested using Verilog. Also imeplemented the Receiver Module on Arduino
Uno and verified error free transfer of messages between the two modules.
